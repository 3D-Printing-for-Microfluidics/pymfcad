# Using the Visualizer

Prev: [Part 2: Installation](2-installation.md)

OpenMFD includes a browser-based visualizer for viewing and interacting with the devices you create. You will use it throughout the tutorial to confirm geometry, labels, and routing.

## Step 1 — Launch the visualizer

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
mfd-serve
```

Or, if using uv:

```bash
uv run mfd-serve
```

This command starts a local web server. If the page does not open automatically, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser. To stop the server, press Enter in the terminal where it is running.

## Step 2 — Understand what it loads

The visualizer displays the **latest preview output** generated by `component.preview()` or `device.preview()`. If you don’t see your model, click **Reload** (lower left) after running preview again.

---

## Step 3 — Navigate the interface

When the visualizer starts, an example device is displayed by default. You can use this device to explore the UI before previewing your own model.

In the upper left corner, you will find a list of toggleable models:

![Toggles](3-2.png)

Expanding this list provides additional control options:

In the lower left corner, there are two buttons: one to reset the camera and another to reload the model:

## Step 4 — Camera controls

You can control the camera using your mouse:

- **Right mouse button:** Orbit the camera around a fixed point.
- **Left mouse button:** Reposition the camera.
- **Scroll wheel:** Zoom in and out.

---

## Step 5 — Toggle models


The toggle controls in the upper left allow you to customize which elements are visible in the visualizer.

- **Device:** Turn on `Device` to view the final bulk-minus-void result. This is the typical rendering for export or slicing.

- **Bounding Box:** Enabling `Bounding Box` displays the black outline representing the bounding box of your device or component.

- **Bulk:** Toggle off `Bounding Box` and enable `Bulk` to show all bulk shapes you created. For complex devices, you can further control visibility of subcategories.

- **Void:** Toggle off `Bulk` and enable `Void` to display all void shapes.

You can also selectively disable specific void categories, such as the `Control` voids, for more granular visualization.

- **Regional Settings:** Turn off `Voids` and enable `Regional` to display regions with special settings. These regions are **not** part of the final geometry, but are visual overlays for configuration and verification.

- **Unconnected Ports:**
	If your device contains ports that are not connected to any other feature, enable `Unconnected Ports` to highlight them:
	- **Red:** OUTLET
	- **Green:** INLET
	- **Blue:** IN/OUT

	This helps you catch missing connections before slicing.

## Quick checks before moving on

- You can open the visualizer and see the example device.
- After running `preview()`, clicking **Reload** shows your latest model.
- You understand how to toggle **Device**, **Bulk**, **Void**, and **Regional** views.

With this overview, you should now be familiar with the visualizer interface and its controls. You are ready to begin designing your own devices.
